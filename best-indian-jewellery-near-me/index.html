You can choose to purchase from a local jewellery store, an online retailer, or even from an Indian jewellery exhibition. However, with so many options available, it can be challenging to know where to start. </p><p>Personally, I've found that the best places to buy Indian jewellery near me are local jewellery stores that specialize in Indian jewellery. These stores typically have a vast selection of jewellery pieces to choose from, ranging from traditional to modern styles. Moreover, the staff is knowledgeable and can help you choose the right piece that fits your style and budget. </p><p>Another great option is to attend an Indian jewellery exhibition. These events are typically held in large cities and offer a vast selection of jewellery pieces from various vendors. You can find unique and one-of-a-kind pieces that you won't find anywhere else. However, keep in mind that the prices may be higher at these events due to the exclusivity of the pieces.</p><p><h2>The Different Types of Indian Jewellery</h2></p><p>Indian jewellery is known for its intricate designs and stunning gemstones. There are several different types of Indian jewellery to choose from, each with its unique style and significance. Some of the most popular types of Indian jewellery include:</p><p><h3>1. Kundan Jewellery</h3></p><p>Kundan jewellery is made of gold and precious gemstones like diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. The gemstones are set using a technique called kundan, where the gems are set into a gold foil. Kundan jewellery is known for its elaborate and intricate designs and is typically worn for special occasions like weddings.</p><p><h4>How to Style Kundan Jewellery</h4></p><p>Kundan jewellery pairs well with traditional Indian outfits like sarees, lehengas, and salwar kameez. It's best to keep the rest of your accessories minimal, allowing the jewellery to be the focal point of your look.</p><p><h3>2. Polki Jewellery</h3></p><p>Polki jewellery is similar to kundan jewellery, but instead of using gold foil, the gems are set directly into the gold. Polki jewellery is known for its antique and vintage look and is typically more expensive than kundan jewellery.</p><p><h4>How to Style Polki Jewellery</h4></p><p>Polki jewellery looks great with traditional Indian outfits and can also be paired with modern western outfits for a fusion look.</p><p><h3>3. Temple Jewellery</h3></p><p>Temple jewellery is inspired by temple art and architecture and is typically made of gold. The jewellery features intricate designs of gods and goddesses, making it a popular choice for religious occasions.</p><p><h4>How to Style Temple Jewellery</h4></p><p>Temple jewellery pairs well with traditional Indian outfits like sarees, lehengas, and salwar kameez.
