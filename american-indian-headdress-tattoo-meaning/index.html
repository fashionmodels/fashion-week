This is because the headdress is considered a sacred item in Native American culture that should only be worn by those who have earned the right to do so.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding this tattoo design, many people still choose to get it as a way to honor Native American culture and show their appreciation for its beauty and symbolism.

First, you should think about the size and placement of the tattoo. Do you want a small headdress tattoo on your wrist, or a larger one on your back?
