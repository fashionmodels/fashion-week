The truth is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question as it largely depends on personal preference and comfort level.</p><p>However, if you are someone who is prone to infections or has sensitive skin, it is best to avoid wearing underwear to bed. This is because the private area needs to breathe and wearing tight-fitting underwear can restrict airflow, leading to sweating and an increased risk of infections. On the other hand, if you feel uncomfortable sleeping without underwear, you can opt for loose-fitting cotton underwear that allows your skin to breathe.</p><p>To sum it up, whether or not to wear underwear to bed is a personal choice that depends on individual comfort and preference. However, it is important to keep in mind that tight-fitting underwear can increase the risk of infections and skin irritation, while loose-fitting cotton underwear can help keep the private area clean and dry.</p><p><h2>Benefits of Wearing Underwear to Bed</h2></p><p>Personally, I have always preferred wearing underwear to bed as it makes me feel comfortable and secure.
