Prepare your home: Before surgery, make sure to prepare your home for your recovery. You might need to install grab bars, a shower chair, or a raised toilet seat.</p><p>4. Stock up on supplies: You will need to stock up on supplies such as ice packs, bandages, and medication before surgery.</p><p><h2>FAQs About Wearing Underwear During Knee Surgery</h2></p><p><b>Q: Can I wear my own underwear during knee surgery?</b></p><p>A: Yes, you can wear your own underwear to the hospital, but you will have to change into hospital gowns before the surgery.</p><p><b>Q: Do I need to shave before knee surgery?</b></p><p>A: It is not necessary to shave before knee surgery.
