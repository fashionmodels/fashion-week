The platform has a massive audience and allows you to set your own prices and shipping fees. Plus, eBay's policies protect both buyers and sellers, which can give you peace of mind when selling online.</p><p>When selling on eBay, it's important to do your research on the value of your items and to take clear, high-quality photos of them.

These types of stores often specialize in vintage and designer items, making them a natural fit for your pieces.</p><p>When selling at consignment shops and vintage stores, it's important to do your research on their policies and commission rates. You'll also want to make sure that your items are clean, in good condition, and priced appropriately for the store's target market.
