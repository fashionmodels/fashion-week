For one, there are so many great fights to choose from that it can be difficult to narrow it down to just a few. Additionally, different fans may have different opinions on what constitutes a "great" fight, which can lead to debates and disagreements.</p><p>So, what are the most famous boxing matches in history? In this article, we'll explore some of the most iconic fights in boxing history and discuss why they are so revered by fans and experts alike.</p><p>To summarize, this article will explore the most famous boxing matches in history and provide an in-depth look at what makes them so special. We'll cover everything from the "Fight of the Century" to the "Rumble in the Jungle," and we'll discuss the impact that these fights had on the sport of boxing as a whole.</p><h2>The Fight of the Century</h2><p>The Fight of the Century was a boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier that took place on March 8, 1971. The fight was hyped up as the biggest sporting event of the year, and it lived up to its billing. It was the first time that two undefeated heavyweight champions had faced each other in a boxing ring.</p><p>As someone who has always been a fan of boxing, watching the Fight of the Century was a truly unforgettable experience. I remember feeling a sense of awe and excitement as Ali and Frazier stepped into the ring, knowing that I was about to witness something truly special.</p><p>The fight itself was a back-and-forth battle that lasted for 15 rounds. Frazier ultimately won the fight by unanimous decision, but both fighters left everything they had in the ring. The Fight of the Century is widely regarded as one of the greatest boxing matches of all time, and it helped to establish Ali and Frazier as two of the sport's biggest icons.</p><h2>The Thrilla in Manila</h2><p>The Thrilla in Manila was a boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier that took place on October 1, 1975. The fight was the third and final meeting between the two fighters, and it is widely regarded as one of the most brutal and intense fights in boxing history.</p><p>As someone who has always been fascinated by the mental and physical aspects of boxing, watching the Thrilla in Manila was an experience that I will never forget. The fight was a true test of endurance and willpower, as both Ali and Frazier pushed themselves to their absolute limits.</p><p>The fight lasted for 14 rounds, with Ali ultimately emerging victorious by TKO. However, both fighters were battered and bruised by the end of the bout, and Ali famously described the fight as "the closest thing to dying that I know of."</p><h3>The Rumble in the Jungle</h3><p>The Rumble in the Jungle was a boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman that took place on October 30, 1974. The fight was held in Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and was the first major sporting event to be held in Africa.</p><p>As someone who has always been interested in the cultural impact of sports, watching the Rumble in the Jungle was a truly fascinating experience. The fight was a showcase of African culture and identity, and it helped to establish Ali as a global ambassador for social justice and equality.</p><p>The fight itself was a masterclass in boxing strategy, as Ali used his famed "rope-a-dope" technique to tire out Foreman and then knock him out in the eighth round. The Rumble in the Jungle is widely regarded as one of the greatest upsets in boxing history, and it cemented Ali's status as one of the sport's all-time greats.</p><h4>How to Watch the Most Famous Boxing Matches in History</h4><p>If you're interested in watching some of the most famous boxing matches in history, there are several ways to do so.

The fights were significant for several reasons, including Ali's controversial victory in the first fight and his dominant win in the second fight.</p><p>As someone who has always been interested in the political and social aspects of sports, the Ali vs. Liston fights were particularly fascinating to me.
