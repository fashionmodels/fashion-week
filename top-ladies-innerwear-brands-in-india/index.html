It is recommended to get measured by a professional to ensure the right fit. The material should be comfortable and breathable, and the design should cater to your specific needs. For example, if you require extra support, then a sports bra or a bra with underwire may be a better option.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How often should I replace my innerwear?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> It is recommended that you replace your innerwear every six months to a year, depending on how frequently you wear it.
