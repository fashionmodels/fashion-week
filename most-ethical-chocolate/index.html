This can lead to better education, health, and community development.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p>Q: Is most ethical chocolate more expensive than regular chocolate?</p><p>A: Ethical chocolate can be slightly more expensive than conventional chocolate due to the higher costs of sustainable and fair production.
