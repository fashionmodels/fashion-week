Are you planning to visit the city and want to know what to wear? The traditional dress of Dubai is not just a fashion statement, but also a symbol of Emirati culture and heritage. In this article, we will take a closer look at the traditional dress of Dubai and its significance.</p><p>The traditional dress of Dubai can be a source of confusion for visitors, especially those who may not be familiar with the customs and traditions of the Emirati people. However, not adhering to the dress code can be seen as a sign of disrespect, which is why it is important to understand what is expected of you.</p><p>The traditional dress of Dubai for men is called a kandura or dishdasha, which is a long, loose-fitting robe made of cotton or wool. It is usually white in color, which helps to reflect the harsh desert sun. For women, the traditional dress is called an abaya, which is a long, black robe that covers the entire body, except for the hands and face. It is usually made of lightweight fabric, such as cotton or silk. Both men and women wear head coverings, with men wearing a headscarf called a ghutra, and women wearing a headscarf called a shayla.</p><p>In summary, the traditional dress of Dubai consists of a kandura or dishdasha for men, and an abaya for women, both of which are long, loose-fitting robes that cover the entire body. Both men and women wear head coverings, with men wearing a ghutra and women wearing a shayla.</p><p><h2>The Significance of Emirati Clothing</h2></p><p>As mentioned earlier, the traditional dress of Dubai is not just a fashion statement, but also a symbol of Emirati culture and heritage. The clothing is designed to be comfortable and practical, while also reflecting the values and traditions of the Emirati people.</p><p>Personally, as an Emirati, I wear traditional clothing on special occasions such as weddings, national holidays, and religious events. It makes me feel proud of my culture and heritage, and it helps to strengthen my connection to my roots.</p><p><h2>How to Wear Emirati Clothing</h2></p><p>If you are planning to wear traditional Emirati clothing, it is important to do so respectfully. For men, the kandura or dishdasha should be worn with a white or beige headscarf, and black sandals or loafers. For women, the abaya should be worn with a headscarf that matches the color of the abaya, and closed-toe shoes.</p><p><h3>The Evolution of Emirati Clothing</h3></p><p>The traditional dress of Dubai has evolved over time, with new styles and fabrics being introduced. For example, some men now wear colored kanduras, and women may wear abayas with embellishments or embroidery. However, the basic design and structure of the clothing has remained the same, reflecting the importance of tradition and heritage in Emirati culture.</p><p><h4>Where to Buy Emirati Clothing</h4></p><p>If you are interested in buying traditional Emirati clothing, there are many stores in Dubai that specialize in selling kanduras, dishdashas, and abayas. Some popular stores include Dubai Mall, Mall of Emirates, and Deira City Centre. You can also find traditional clothing at local souks and markets, such as the Gold Souk and the Spice Souk.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of the Traditional Dress of Dubai</h2></p><p>Understanding the traditional dress of Dubai is an important part of respecting Emirati culture and heritage. Whether you are a visitor or a resident, wearing traditional Emirati clothing on special occasions can help you connect with the local culture and feel a sense of pride in being part of it.</p><p><b>Question and Answer:</b></p><p><b>Q:</b> Is it necessary to wear traditional Emirati clothing in Dubai?</p><p><b>A:</b> No, it is not necessary to wear traditional Emirati clothing in Dubai.
