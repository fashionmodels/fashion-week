They should have excellent customer service and be responsive to your needs.</p><p><b>Location:</b> Choose a dealer that is located near your store or has a reliable shipping system. This reduces the risk of delayed deliveries and transportation costs.</p><p><h2>Where to Find Wholesale Clothing Dealers in India</h2></p><p>The best places to find wholesale clothing dealers in India include online directories, trade shows, and referrals.</p><p><b>Online directories:</b> Online directories such as IndiaMART, TradeIndia, and Exporters India have a list of wholesale clothing dealers in India.
