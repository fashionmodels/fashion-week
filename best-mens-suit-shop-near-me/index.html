The shoulder seams should sit at the edge of your shoulders, and the sleeves should be the right length (ending at your wrist bone).</p><p><strong>Q: How many buttons should my suit jacket have?</strong></p><p>A: This depends on the style of the suit. Generally, a two-button suit is the most versatile and flattering.</p><p><strong>Q: What color suit should I wear to a job interview?</strong></p><p>A: A navy or charcoal suit is a safe and professional choice for a job interview.</p><p><strong>Q: How often should I dry clean my suit?</strong></p><p>A: It's best to dry clean your suit only when necessary (i.e. when it's visibly dirty or has an odor).
