When every trick was an expression of your personality and every shoe was a statement of your identity? If you are a true skateboarding enthusiast, you know that the right pair of shoes can make all the difference in your performance and your look. But what about the old skate shoe brands that shaped the scene before the big names took over? Let's take a trip back in time and rediscover the legends of skate shoes.</p><p>Back in the golden age of skateboarding, the options for skate shoes were limited, but the quality was unmatched. Skaters had to rely on their own ingenuity to customize their shoes and make them last longer. The shoes were not only a tool for skating but also a symbol of the skater's individuality and subculture. However, as the skateboarding industry grew and became more commercialized, the small independent brands were pushed aside by the big corporations that dominated the market. This led to a decline in the diversity, creativity, and authenticity of skate shoes.</p><p>So, what is the appeal of old skate shoe brands? Why do some skaters still seek them out and cherish them? For many, it is a matter of nostalgia and respect for the pioneers of the sport. For others, it is a way to stand out from the crowd and express their unique style. Some skaters also appreciate the durability, comfort, and performance of the old school shoes that were designed for pure skateboarding, without any gimmicks or distractions.</p><p>In this article, we will explore some of the most iconic old skate shoe brands and their legacy in the skateboarding culture. From Vans to Airwalk, from Etnies to Osiris, we will dive into the history, features, and influence of each brand. We will also discuss the current status of these brands and their relevance in the modern skateboarding world. Whether you are a seasoned skater or a curious newcomer, this guide will give you a glimpse into the rich heritage of skate shoes.</p><h2>Vans: The Original Skate Shoe</h2><p>When it comes to old skate shoe brands, Vans is undoubtedly the king of the hill. Founded in 1966 by Paul Van Doren, Vans quickly became the go-to shoe for skateboarders in Southern California. The simple yet sturdy design of the Vans Authentic model was perfect for the rough and tumble world of skateboarding, and soon the brand became synonymous with the sport. Vans also gained popularity among other subcultures, such as punk rock and BMX, and became a cultural icon of youth rebellion.</p><p>My personal experience with Vans goes back to my early days of skating, when I was still learning the basics and trying to find my style. I remember seeing the older skaters at my local park wearing Vans and thinking that they looked so cool and confident. I saved up some money and bought my first pair of Vans Authentics, and immediately felt a sense of belonging and pride. The shoes were comfortable, durable, and versatile, and I could wear them with any outfit. They also gave me the confidence to try new tricks and push my limits.</p><p>Vans has evolved over the years and expanded its line of products to include various styles and collaborations with artists and designers. However, the core values of Vans remain the same: authenticity, creativity, and community. Vans is still a major player in the skateboarding industry and continues to inspire generations of skaters around the world.</p><h2>Airwalk: The Game Changer</h2><p>Another old skate shoe brand that made a significant impact on the scene is Airwalk. Founded in 1986 by Bill Mann and George Yohn, Airwalk introduced a new level of technology and design to skate shoes. The Airwalk Prototype model was the first shoe to feature an air cushioning system, which provided extra shock absorption and comfort for skaters. The shoe also had a sleek and futuristic look, which appealed to the emerging streetwear culture of the 90s.</p><p>My first encounter with Airwalk was through a skateboarding video that featured some of the top pros of the time, such as Tony Hawk and Rodney Mullen. The video showcased the amazing performance and style of the Airwalk shoes, and I was instantly hooked. I begged my parents to buy me a pair of Airwalk Jims, and when I finally got them, I felt like a pro myself. The shoes were so light and responsive, and I could feel the air cushioning working its magic on my landings. I also loved the edgy and futuristic design of the shoes, which made me stand out from the crowd.</p><p>Although Airwalk had its ups and downs over the years, the brand still holds a special place in the hearts of many skaters who grew up with it. Airwalk is now owned by Payless Shoes, but the spirit of innovation and creativity lives on in its products.</p><h3>Etnies: The Skateboarder's Shoe</h3><p>One of the oldest and most respected skate shoe brands is Etnies. Founded in 1986 by Pierre André Senizergues, a French pro skater, Etnies was the first brand to be owned and operated by a skateboarder. This gave Etnies a unique perspective on the needs and preferences of skaters, and allowed the brand to create shoes that were specifically designed for skateboarding.</p><p>My first exposure to Etnies was through a skateboarding magazine that featured a full-page ad for the Etnies Sal 23 model. The ad showed Sal Barbier, a legendary skater, doing a huge kickflip while wearing the shoes, and I was instantly impressed. I did some research and found out that Etnies was all about skateboarding and skaters, and that they had a team of top riders who tested and approved every product. I knew I had to try the shoes myself, and when I did, I was blown away by the comfort, durability, and style of the Etnies shoes. I also loved the fact that Etnies supported the skateboarding community and sponsored many events and riders.</p><p>Etnies has continued to innovate and evolve over the years, and has expanded its line of products to include apparel, accessories, and even eco-friendly shoes. However, the core mission of Etnies remains the same: to provide the best possible shoes for skateboarders, by skateboarders.</p><h4>Osiris: The Bold and the Brave</h4><p>One of the newer old skate shoe brands is Osiris. Founded in 1996 by Tony Chen and Brian Reid, Osiris was a bold and daring brand that pushed the boundaries of skate shoe design. The Osiris D3 model, which featured a chunky and futuristic look, became a cult classic and a symbol of the "nu-metal" era of skateboarding. Osiris also introduced many other innovative features, such as hidden lacing systems, airbags, and custom artwork.</p><p>My first introduction to Osiris was through a skateboarding video that featured Dave Mayhew, one of the most influential skaters of the time, wearing the D3 shoes. I was amazed by the size and shape of the shoes, and I wondered how anyone could skate in them. However, when I tried a pair of Osiris shoes myself, I realized that they were not only comfortable and supportive but also very durable and resistant to wear and tear. I also appreciated the bold and creative designs of the shoes, which made me feel like I was part of a rebellious and expressive subculture.</p><p>Osiris has had its ups and downs over the years, and has gone through some changes in ownership and management. However, the brand still stands for innovation, creativity, and individuality, and continues to attract skaters who want to make a statement with their footwear.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h3>Q: Are old skate shoe brands still relevant in the modern skateboarding world?</h3><p>A: Yes, old skate shoe brands still have a place in the modern skateboarding world, as they offer a unique and authentic perspective on the sport and its culture. Many skaters appreciate the history, style, and quality of the old school shoes, and choose to wear them as a tribute to the pioneers of skateboarding.</p><h3>Q: Do old skate shoe brands still produce new models or collaborate with other brands?</h3><p>A: Yes, many old skate shoe brands still produce new models and collaborate with other brands and artists. Some brands have even reissued their classic models with updated features and materials. However, the availability and distribution of these products may vary depending on the brand and the location.</p><h3>Q: Are old skate shoe brands more durable and comfortable than modern skate shoes?</h3><p>A: It depends on the brand and the model. Some old skate shoe brands were known for their durability and comfort, while others were not. Similarly, some modern skate shoes are designed to be durable and comfortable, while others prioritize style and innovation over functionality. It is important to choose a skate shoe that fits your needs and preferences, regardless of its age or brand.</p><h3>Q: What is the best way to take care of old skate shoes?</h3><p>A: The best way to take care of old skate shoes is to clean them regularly and store them properly. Use a soft brush or cloth to remove dirt and stains, and avoid using harsh detergents or chemicals that may damage the materials. Air dry the shoes after cleaning, and avoid exposing them to direct sunlight </article>
