Additionally, if your suit has any stains or damage, it may cost more to clean.</p><p>Personal Experience: I have a silk suit that I wore to a wedding, and it cost me $40 to have it dry cleaned. However, my regular wool suit only costs me $20.</p><p><h3>How to Save Money on Suit Dry Cleaning</h3></p><p>If you want to save money on suit dry cleaning, there are a few things you can do. First, shop around for the best price. You may be able to find a dry cleaner that offers a lower price for the same service.
