This mutation also causes them to have a higher risk of deafness, which is a concern for potential owners. However, many still find them adorable and unique, making them a popular choice despite the risks.</p><p>In summary, the most expensive boxer color is the white boxer. It is sought after by those who are willing to pay a premium for a rare and unique dog. White boxers have a predominantly white coat with some markings in either fawn or brindle. While they come with a higher risk of deafness, many still find them irresistible.</p><p><h2>The Appeal of White Boxers</h2></p><p>As a dog lover, I have had the pleasure of owning a white boxer. I can attest that their unique appearance is what initially drew me to them. Their white coat and contrasting markings are striking and make them stand out from other boxers. As I got to know my white boxer, I fell in love with their playful and loyal nature. They are intelligent and easy to train, making them an ideal companion.</p><p><h2>The Rarity of White Boxers</h2></p><p>White boxers are rare, with only around 20% of boxers carrying the mutation that causes the white coat. This rarity adds to their appeal and makes them more valuable. Breeders charge a premium for white boxers, which can range from $1,500 to $4,000 or more. While the higher price tag may deter some, those who are willing to pay for a unique dog will find it worth the cost.</p><p><h3>The Risks of Owning a White Boxer</h3></p><p>As mentioned earlier, white boxers have a higher risk of deafness than other boxers. Around 18% of white boxers are born deaf in one or both ears. This risk is due to the same genetic mutation that causes their white coat. While deafness can be a concern, many owners of white boxers find ways to work around it and still provide a loving home for their furry friend.</p><p><h4>How to Care for a White Boxer</h4></p><p>Like any other boxer, white boxers require regular exercise, a healthy diet, and proper grooming. However, due to their white coat, they may need more frequent baths to keep their fur clean and bright. Owners may also need to take extra precautions to protect their white boxer from sunburn and skin cancer, as their skin is more prone to damage from UV rays.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Are white boxers rare?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, white boxers are rare, with only around 20% of boxers carrying the mutation that causes the white coat.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much does a white boxer cost?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Breeders charge a premium for white boxers, which can range from $1,500 to $4,000 or more.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Do white boxers have a higher risk of deafness?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, around 18% of white boxers are born deaf in one or both ears due to the same genetic mutation that causes their white coat.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you care for a white boxer?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> White boxers require regular exercise, a healthy diet, and proper grooming.
