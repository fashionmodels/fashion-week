This will help your description appear in search engine results and attract more traffic to your website.</p><p>For example, if you're selling organic cotton clothing, you might include keywords like "sustainable," "eco-friendly," and "organic" in your description.</p><h4>How to Write a Clothing Business Description in Relaxed English</h4><p>Finally, when writing your clothing business description, it's important to use relaxed English that's easy for your target audience to understand.
