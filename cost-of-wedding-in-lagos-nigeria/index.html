One of the first things you should do is set a budget and stick to it. Determine how much money you can realistically afford to spend on your wedding, and then prioritize the most important aspects of your day, such as the venue, food, and entertainment.

Depending on the type of package you choose, you can expect to pay anywhere from ₦500,000 to ₦2,000,000 or more for your wedding photos and videos. To save money, consider hiring a local photographer or videographer who is just starting out, or negotiate with your vendor for a more affordable package.</p><p><h4>How to Save Money on Your Wedding in Lagos Nigeria</h4></p><p>There are many ways to save money on your wedding in Lagos Nigeria, including choosing a less expensive venue, having a smaller guest list, and DIY-ing your decorations. You can also opt for a cash gift registry instead of traditional gifts, and ask friends and family to help with certain aspects of your wedding, such as music or photography.
