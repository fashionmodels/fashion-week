Many luxury fashion houses use rare or exotic materials in their designs, such as crocodile skin or silk spun from rare species of silkworms.</p><p>In addition to the materials used, these brands often have a rich history and heritage that sets them apart from other fashion houses. For example, Chanel is known for its iconic quilted handbags and timeless designs that have been worn by many influential women throughout history.</p><h3>The Most Expensive Clothing Brands in the World</h3><p>Now, let's get to the list of the most expensive clothing brands in the world.
