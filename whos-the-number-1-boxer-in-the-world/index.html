The question remains, who is the number 1 boxer in the world?Boxing fans always have pain points related to this question, such as who is the most skilled, who is the most entertaining to watch, and who has the most impressive record. All of these factors come into play when determining who the best boxer in the world is.Currently, the answer to the question of who is the number 1 boxer in the world is Canelo Alvarez.

A fighter who can outmaneuver and outthink their opponent is often seen as more skilled than a fighter who relies solely on power.What&#39;s Next for Canelo Alvarez?Canelo Alvarez&#39;s career is far from over, and fans are excited to see what the future holds for the Mexican superstar.
