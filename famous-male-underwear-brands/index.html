Over time, underwear can lose their elasticity and become less supportive, so it's essential to replace them regularly.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I wear the same underwear for multiple days?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> It is not recommended to wear the same underwear for multiple days as it can lead to health issues such as infections and unpleasant odors.
